Dashboard to measure clinical productivity for behavioral health

 Comprehensive tracking of productivity is critical, with demand for increased staff productivity fueled by multiple developments in the funding environment:
* Declining reimbursement and lower margins
* Push to assume increasing risk through risk sharing reimbursement arrangements
* Rising human resource costs require careful monitoring of investments in people's time
* Shifts in future funding will lead to competition for consumers based on efficiency and value

Productivity measurement asks how well an organization can coordinate separate resources (e.g. people, machines, paperwork) into useful goods or services. It's a relationship between inputs and outputs, or Units of Output / Units of Input.
